# Feature Branch: Version 2.0

This will be the main working branch for the short term future, as I'm planning to do a major rewrite of the whole mod to fix some internal issues that have creeped in early when I was first starting work on this mod. A clear roadmap is not yet available, neither a timeframe given my current life circumstances.

All old issues have been closed for now, as they are no longer relevant with this rewrite planned. All progress and planning will be tracked through the issues and the project board.

## Netrve's DeepStorage GUI

A Mod-Mod for LittleWhiteMouse's DeepStorage ([Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1617282896)) that overhauls the user interface it offers.

Currently, changes both the Storage Tab and the Right Click Orders menu.

Both come with options for sorting, customizable appearance, and search functionality. Aside from offering some Quality Of Life improvements, I have also paid a lot of attention to optimizing the inner workings as best as I could without compromising compatibility.
