# Netrve's DeepStorage GUI

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/Dakraid/RW_DSGUI/_apis/build/status/Dakraid.RW_DSGUI?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/Dakraid/RW_DSGUI/_build?definitionId=1)

A Mod-Mod for LittleWhiteMouse's DeepStorage ([Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1617282896)) that overhauls the user interface it offers.

Currently, changes both the Storage Tab and the Right Click Orders menu.

Both come with options for sorting, customizable appearance, and search functionality. Aside from offering some Quality Of Life improvements, I have also paid a lot of attention to optimizing the inner workings as best as I could without compromising compatibility.

#### Requires LWM DeepStorage

## Download
I recommend downloading the mod through the Workshop, if you can't please follow the instructions below this.
- [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2169841018)

Alternatively you can go for more recent, but not officially recommended downloads, following this:
- Go to the Pipeline linked [here](https://dev.azure.com/Dakraid/RW_DSGUI/_build?definitionId=1)
- Click on the top-most "Run"
- Under "Related" click on "Published"
- Click on the three dots and select "Download artifacts"
