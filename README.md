# Netrve's DeepStorage GUI

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/Dakraid/RW_DSGUI/_apis/build/status/Dakraid.RW_DSGUI?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/Dakraid/RW_DSGUI/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)

A Mod-Mod for LittleWhiteMouse's DeepStorage ([Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1617282896)) that overhauls the user interface it offers.

Currently, changes both the Storage Tab and the Right Click Orders menu.

Both come with options for sorting, customizable appearance, and search functionality. Aside from offering some Quality Of Life improvements, I have also paid a lot of attention to optimizing the inner workings as best as I could without compromising compatibility.

#### Requires LWM DeepStorage

## Download
Right now there is no Workshop release as this is still considered a Work-In-Progress.
